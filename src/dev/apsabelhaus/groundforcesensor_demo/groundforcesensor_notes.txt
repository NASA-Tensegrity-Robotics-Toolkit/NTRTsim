Some notes during the process of creating the groundforcesensor functionality.
-Drew Sabelhaus 2016-08-02

First, find out exactly how the tgBasicActuator and friends are created.

-----------------------------
Notes about the classes themselves:

IN CORE:

tgSpringCableActuator
	constructor requires a tgSpringCable reference to be passed in

tgSpringCable
	does NOT inherent from anything
	does NOT contain references to any underlying Bullet classes
	but, does have a list of tgSpringCableAnchor .
	
tgBulletSpringCable
	inherets from tgSpringCable, is a type of tgSringCable
	FORMERLY KNOWN AS muscle2p
	this is the class that applies a force to the anchors!

IN TGCREATOR:

tgStructureInfo
	actually creates the parts of the model by calling functions like

...

-----------------------------
Notes about the flow of function calls:

App creates simulation
App creates tgModel
    simulation calls setup in tgModel
    	       setup creates:
	       	     tgStructure
		     tgStructureInfo
		     tgBuildSpec
			setup adds builders to the buildspec (for example, tgRodInfo and tgBasicActuatorInfo)
	        setup calls tgStructureInfo's buildInto method
		      buildInto calls helper functions inside tgStructureInfo, specifically, calls addRigidsAndConnectors
		      		addRigidsAndConnectors calls the methods:
					getConnectorAgents, inside tgBuildSpec
					initConnectorInfo, inside itself (the tgStructureInfo class). Uses the connectorAgents from getConnectorAgents.
						calls infoFactory from each connectorAgent. connectorAgent is inside tgBuildSpec.
						infoFactory returns a tgConnectorInfo (NOTE THAT tgRigidInfo and tgConnectorInfo are infoFactories.)
						tgConnectorInfo calls its createConnectorInfo method.
					initConnectors, inside itself
						calls initConnector from each tgConnectorInfo
						      initConnector is only defined in subclasses of ConnectorInfo. For example, in tgBasicActuatorInfo,
						      

-----------------------------

What I will need to do:

FOR THE COMPRESSION SPRING ITSELF:
Create the classes:

tgCompressionSpring (equivalent to tgSpringCable)
	not-quite-abstract class that defines the behavior of a compression spring
	just like tgSpringCable, but with requirements about pos/neg of spring constants to be flipped etc.
	MIGHT NOT NEED THIS ONE, unless we want fancy polymorphism.

tgBulletCompressionSpring (equivalent to tgBulletSpringCable)
	just like tgBulletSpringCable. Might actually be almost exactly the same code.

TO CHECK:
   can we re-use tgSpringCableAnchor and tgBulletSpringCableAnchor?
       Probably. In particular, tgBulletSpringCableAnchor refers to a btRigidBody directly, and
       since our world is a btRigidBody, then it could attach.
       Additionally, we may not even need two anchors for our ground force sensor: the sensor could
       just have a reference to its own non-moving point in space (a btVector3) as the anchor of the spring.

   where is tgSpringCable used in the builder? it looks like tgBulletCompressionSpring is used directly.

FOR THE BUILDER:

tgCompressionSpringInfo
	see: tgBasicActuatorInfo

ORDER OF OPERATIONS FOR THE CLASSES TO CREATE:

1) tgCompressionSpringActuatorInfo
	will call or use:
	     tgBulletCompressionSpring
	     tgBulletSpringCableAnchor (...this should be OK, unless Bullet tries to apply a force on the world ground and then crashes...)
	      ^ the header file for this is added in the .cpp file for tgCompressionSpringActuatorInfo.

2) tgCompressionSpringActuator
        As per the tgBulletSpringCable/tgBasicActuatorInfo/tgBasicActuator trio of classes, the new compression spring should also have
	the trio of tgBulletCompressionSpring/tgCompressionSpringActuatorInfo/tgCompressionSpringActuator.
	Look into the tgBasicActuator class for this one.
	Need to (a) put the config from tgSpringCableActuator here, and (b) modify it to have restLength and not pretension, (c) add this class to the YAML builder.
	     see tgCompressionSpringActuatorInfo versus tgBasicActuatorInfo for the use of the config struct.
	     
3) tgBulletCompressionSpring
	Use the class from tgBulletSpringCable.

^ above done 7pm 2016-08-02

4) Demo using a tgCompressionSpringActuator

CHANGES TO THINK ABOUT WHEN COPYING OVER tgSpringCableActuator INTO tgCompressionSpringActuator:
	Check on tgBulletRenderer. Calls a method from tgSpringCableActuator that returned a tgSpringCable.
	      tgCompressionSpringActuator's onVisit method calls the render method of tgModelVisitor.
	      Might have to implement virtual void render(const tgCompressionSpringActuator& compressionSpringActuator) const {}; in tgDataLogger and tscDataLogger.
	      ^ done as of 5pm 2016-08-02.
	      Fill in the getRestLength() and related methods in tgCompressionSpringActuator once I've written them in tgBulletCompressionSpring.
	      ^ this is needed if we actually want to drawn the force sensors in the NTRT window.
	There is some "scale" thing going on in tgSpringCableActuator. Is this called from somewhere else? Does it need to be implemented in tgCompressionSpring?
	      ^ might be something in tgBulletRenderer...
	Check all the CMakeLists files to be sure all the new files are included.

As of 8:30pm 2016-08-02, it looks like this is actually working. The one potential problem might be the calculations inside
tgBulletCompressionSpring, since I couldn't quite tell if the calculations from tgBulletSpringCable would still apply... there
is something weird with changing the magnitude of the spring force vs. damping force.

To-Do 2016-08-03: Make a TwoBoxesModel class instead of a TwoRods class, since the rods just rolled around and I couldn't
determine if the forces were being applied correctly.
See Brian's BoxFeet model for a useage of tgBox.

^ 2016-08-03 12:30pm confirmed working! We now have a tgCompressionSpringActuator class.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2016-08-03:

Now, make the sensor.
One option for the spring should be:
    - fixed on one end. aka, have a specified vertical location of the fixed end, or a specified btVector3 like (~, height, ~).
    - Apply a force only in the vertical direction
    - Apply a force proportional only to the z-distance between the fixed end and the moving end

Questions to answer:
	  - can we apply forces to a surface instead of just a point? Or will we need to have (for example) four springs on the bottom of our force plate?
	  - is it OK for the robot feet to float in space, or do we need to have the force sensor between a plate and object so the robot doesn't slide around?


Classes to make:

1) tgFixedVerticalCompressionSpring (corresponds to tgCompressionSpringActuator)

2) tgFixedVerticalCompressionSpringInfo (corresponds to tgCompressionSpringActuator)

3) tgBulletFixedVerticalCompressionSpring
