# This is the fixed "vertebra" that's used as a mounting point for the 2D spine hardware test.

# For now, it just uses the frame from MATLAB, *not* centered at the CoM.

# Notes on dimensions:
# "X" is positive to the left, ugh. We're using NTRT's frame for ease but the visualization looks backwards.
# ALSO, "Y" positive goes "backward/into the page", not towards the viewer. So, we
# also switch the right/left from the MATLAB calculations.

# Taken directly from the MATLAB script.
