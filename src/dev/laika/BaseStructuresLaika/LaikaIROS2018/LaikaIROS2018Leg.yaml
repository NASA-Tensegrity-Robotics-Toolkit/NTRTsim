# This YAML file has two parts:
# (1) Leg box, single leg, local frame is at top of leg
# (2) foot, which is a "sphere" approxed in place of a "rod" since it's easier
# to align the nodes that way.

nodes:
  # First vertex is at origin, allows for easy attachment to hips.
  legtop: [0, 0, 0]
  # no translation in X or "Z", perfectly in the "Y" plane.
  # Legs are 22.1cm from top to full bottom, so we need to subtract
  # away half the top height (to align the legtop node with the hips)
  # and the foot radius (to align legboxend with foot.)
  # 22.1 - (6/2) - 1.25
  legboxend: [0, -17.85, 0]
  # Instead of a rod, put a sphere with the same radius, at legboxend.

pair_groups:
  legBox:
    - [legtop, legboxend]

builders:
  # Let's do the box for the leg.
  # It's 0.3 cm thick (in X) and 2.5 cm wide (in Y.)
