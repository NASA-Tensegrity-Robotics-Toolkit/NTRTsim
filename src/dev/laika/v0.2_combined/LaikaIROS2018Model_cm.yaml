# YAML file for the Laika IROS 2018 submission.
# These calculations place the origin as in-between the two feet at the robot's rear.
# Includes the front/rear, and then two vert / rot vert / two vert for 5 total.

# We're going to assemble with the rear two feet across the origin,
# so move the rear's origin (attachment for t1) up by the leg's vertical amount,
# and "forward" (-X) by the leg attachment point.

# NOTE: The vertical displacement is leg height plus the 1.5 offset of the ground
# (ground is not at origin.) So, that's 19.35 + 1.5 = 19.35

# TO-DO: switch around the labelling of foot ABCD, since Y has to be switched
# same as +/- X. E.g, front-right foot is actually at -x, -y.

    # the hips if the intersection is exactly 52.3. Who knows why or how
    # this is happening. Hack for now is to make a slight offset.
    # This probably means there's a pointer problem somewhere.
