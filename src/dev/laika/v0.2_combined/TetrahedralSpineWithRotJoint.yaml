# YAML file for the Horizontal Spine with kinematic actuators.
# Used for the 2017 ULTRA Spine ICRA paper.

# This spine has multiple substructures,
# including the spine itself (t1-t6) and the supporting pieces.
# Adding translation [22, 0, -22] to remove need for "Dropped".
substructures:

  t1/t2:
    path: ./TetrahedronSymmetric.yaml
    #offset: [-12, 0 , 0]
    # used to use the 'scaled' version
    offset: [-6, 0, 0]
    #translation: [22, 40.5, 8] # was 30.5
    # also, since now centered at the origin, and twice the size,
    # center it same as the rot vert.
    translation: [10, 45.5, 8]
  t5/t6:
    path: ./TetrahedronSymmetric.yaml
    #offset: [-12, 0 , 0]
    offset: [-6, 0 , 0]
    # RotVert gives -4, -6 gap, -2 offset = -12
    #translation: [-21, 40.5, 8] # TwoSegSpine gives -12 + -5 = -17 extra (-41)
    translation: [-12, 45.5, 8]
  rotJoint:
    path: ./RotVertHalved.yaml
    #scale: 0.5
    # was y = 35.5, before adjusting local frame to the origin. Also rescaled the local YAML file, since in the future we want to get rid of all the scale = 0.5
    translation: [ -2, 45.5, 8]
  hips:
    path: ../BaseStructuresLaika/SimpleLaika/SimpleRear.yaml
    translation: [10, 45.5, 8]
  front:
    path: ../BaseStructuresLaika/SimpleLaika/SimpleFront.yaml
    # we're now at the translation of t5/t6 plus one offset to t6.

# Rod radius reduced to half for tests at 0.5 scale.
# Mass calculations: Robot weighed 1.62 kg on 2016-09-09,
# 1.62 * 9.81 = 15.9 N
# Rod density changed from 0.014 to 0.0044.
# For the saddle cables, spring constant is 7 lb/in = 1226 N/m
# (was either 1000 or 5000)
# For the horizontal cables, spring constant is 1.07 lb/in = 187 N/m
# (was 5000)
# Lowered friction from 1 to 0.5.

# TO-DO: IS rod USED ANYMORE, ANYWHERE?
