# YAML file for the Laika IROS 2018 submission.
# These calculations place the origin as in-between the two feet at the robot's rear.
# Includes the front/rear, and then two vert / rot vert / two vert for 5 total.

# We're going to assemble with the rear two feet across the origin,
# so move the rear's origin (attachment for t1) up by the leg's vertical amount,
# and "forward" (-X) by the leg attachment point.

# For IROS 2018:
# NOTE: The vertical displacement is leg height plus the 1.5 offset of the ground
# (ground is not at origin.) So, that's 17.85 + 1.5 = 19.35

# For ICRA 2019:
# **CORRECTION: We aren't vertically displacing for the ground here!
# That 1.5 offset is in METERS, not cm, and is done in the "FINAL" file that drops
# the robot. Here, the actual correct is for the *feet* of the robot, the spheres.
# That's a radius of 0.0125 meters, so the total y-displacement should really be
# 17.85 + 1.25 = 19.1 cm (0.191 m).

# These units are converted from cm into m (SI units.)

# Define the cable parameters

#############################
# For the IROS 2018 paper, we're using SI units, and these values for the cables
# were calculated in the following way:
# (1) Get constants from Hunter's data on the elastic lattice,
#     via google drive doc
# (2) use the 'calculate...' script in the BaseStructures directory to convert
#     to pretensions from rest lengths.
# The original model used a low-end spring constant for the lattice, at
# 291 for the bottom strip and 174 for all else.
# This was at -1 std dev on the data. Instead, we could try the following:
# Min: bottom = 252, else = 141
# Mean: bottom = 434, else = 244
# Max: bottom = 616, else = 346
# For the black lattice: bottom is estimated at 515 N/m, Holly's data.

# NOTE! min_actual_length defaults to 0.1. This has to change down
# for SI units testing. Same with min rest length.
