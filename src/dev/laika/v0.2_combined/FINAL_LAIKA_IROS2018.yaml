# This is the final version of Laika
# that will be used for the IROS 2018 data.
# We use the 'cm' version, and translate it
# so that it's centered in the camera.
# Total length of the robot is 'front' translation plus 'front' length,
# which would be -52.201 -12.6 -1.25 (for the foot.)
# = -66.051, half = 33.0255
