# This file tries to simulate rods that are 
# similar to SUPERball v2's for mass 
# distribution and size. So there are many
# nodes connected with different properties.
#
# Node Types:
# * Note "#" below correspond to the endcap number on SBv2 *
# n# -> main nodes with strings attached to them
# s# -> nodes to make end cap spheres
# r#0/r#1 -> nodes for connecting rods between endcaps 
# and to connect spheres to the endcap

nodes:
  # Endcap 0
  s0: [0, 0.5, 0]
  r00: [0, 0.8, 0]
  n0: [0, 1.17, 0]
  r01: [0, 2.39, 0]
  # Endcap 1
  r11: [0, 16.19, 0]
  n1: [0, 17.41, 0]
  r10: [0, 17.78, 0]
  s1: [0, 18.08, 0]
