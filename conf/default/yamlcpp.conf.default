# Purpose: Define configuration directives for setup_yamlcpp.sh. 
# Date:    2015-12-12
# Usage:   Copy/rename this file to '../yamlcpp.conf' and run setup.sh

# YamlCPP installation prefix

# Global install: /usr/local, env install: "$ENV_DIR"
# By default, setup will download and install YamlCPP under your env directory.
# If you have an existing YamlCPP install, you should change 
# YAMLCPP_INSTALL_PREFIX to what was used for installation (likely /usr/local).
YAMLCPP_INSTALL_PREFIX="$ENV_DIR"

# Location where YamlCPP is to be built if necessary, or where it was built if 
# you're using an existing package. This doesn't need to be set unless yamlcpp is
# not already installed. 
YAMLCPP_BUILD_DIR="$ENV_DIR/build/yamlcpp_0_5_2"

# This is the location where you unzipped the package (or, where it will
# be unzipped if necessary). 
YAMLCPP_PACKAGE_DIR="$YAMLCPP_BUILD_DIR"

# YAMLCPP_URL can be either a web address or a local file address,
# e.g. http://url.com/for/yamlcpp.tgz or file:///path/to/yamlcpp.tgz
YAMLCPP_URL="https://github.com/jbeder/yaml-cpp/archive/release-0.5.2.zip"
