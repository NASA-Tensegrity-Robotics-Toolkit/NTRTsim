# By default NTRT is built using all of your cores. If you would like
# to statically specify the number of cores, you can simply uncomment the value
# below.
#
# Note: No steps are taken to ensure that the number you provide is less
# than your total number of cores. It shouldn't cause any problems if you pass
# a number greater than your total core count, but there are no guarantees that is indeed
# the case.
#MAX_BUILD_CORES=1
